This directory includes the codes and scripts for using ytopt to autotune the XSBench Version 19, which is one of ECP Proxy Applications 
(https://github.com/ANL-CESAR/XSBench). It requires installing ytopt conda environment (https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt). For the MPI/OpenMP application, it requires MPI and OpenMP programming environments. You can test it at small scale, 
however, make sure to change the compilers to yours.
