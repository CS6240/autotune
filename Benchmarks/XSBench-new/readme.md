This directory includes the codes and scripts for using ytopt to autotune the XSBench Version 19, which is one of ECP Proxy Applications 
(https://github.com/ANL-CESAR/XSBench). It requires installing ytopt conda environment (https://github.com/ytopt-team/ytopt). For the MPI/OpenMP application, it requires MPI and OpenMP programming environments. You can test it at small scale, 
however, make sure to change the compilers to yours.


For the new version of XSBench with LLVM Clang/Polly loop optimization pragma, please follow the instructions from XSBench/readme.md (https://github.com/ytopt-team/autotune/tree/master/Benchmarks/XSBench)
